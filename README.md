# WUSTL Dining  

The goal of this project was to create a website that allows users to view dishes currently being served at Washington University dining halls and rate them. This application was created using MongoDB, Node.js and React. 

`scraping.py` scrapes data from Washington University Dining Services website. 
`/backend` contains all relevant files for the backend API, created using Node.js
`/client` contains the front end React application.
